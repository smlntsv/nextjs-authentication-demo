# Container

The `Container` component is a layout component designed to wrap content with consistent padding and maximum width constraints. It adapts its padding based on the screen size to ensure optimal readability and aesthetics.

## Example

<Canvas of={ContainerStories.Default} sourceState={'shown'} />
<Controls of={ContainerStories.Default} />
